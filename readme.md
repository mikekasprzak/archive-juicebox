# JuiceBox
<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/povrazor/juicebox/master/docs/Logo.png">
Stub for an alternative LD2015 Vagrant configuration, using LEMP (Linux+EnginX+MariaDB+PHP) or other alternative LAMP tools (HHVM?). Juicy.

It should be smaller, faster, and sweeter than the Moo-Juice box we rely on (DairyBox).

# Important Note on JuiceBox
Ludum Dare currently runs a LAMP server (Linux+Apache+MySQL+PHP). Until we begin migration to a LEMP server (or equivalent), this project will remain inactive.

If you wish to contribute to Ludum Dare, use **DairyBox**. JuiceBox is not supported at this time.
