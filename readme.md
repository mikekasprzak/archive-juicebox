# JuiceBox

Stub for a custom Vagrant configuration used by the LD2015 project. Juicy.

It should be smaller, faster, and sweeter than the Moo-Juice we rely on (DairyBox).

# Important Note on JuiceBox
Ludum Dare **doesn't** run LAMP, however our current development VM DairyBox is a LAMP server (Linux+Apache+MySQL+PHP). This is a stub for when we finally create our own configuration that better mirrors what we run on the live servers.

If you wish to contribute to Ludum Dare, use **DairyBox**. JuiceBox is not supported at this time.
